# Capstone Project - Air Pollution and Health Impacts in South and Southeast Asian Countries

Visualization of air pollution data using Shiny and Leaflet package in R

> Air pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. It is responsible for more deaths than many better-known risk factors such as malnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Each year, more people die from air pollutionâ€“related disease than from road traffic injuries or malaria. (State of Global Air Report, 2019)

Using a database compiled from sources including WHO Ambient Air Quality Database, IHME, and State of Global Air, I created a visualization tool that allows users to quickly analyze different trends in air pollution as well as its health impacts. Furthermore, quality of air pollution data is visualized through mapping the locations of air quality monitors across the region by year. All the data are annual measurements at the country level.
