After 2003 there was an increase of contributions from industry and has been the major source of PM2.5 mass since 2004. Contribution of natural sources; soil and biomass burning ranged from 2.1 to 5.7% and 4.0 to 15.6% respectively, whilst contributions from secondary sulphate ranged from 2.8 to 7.3%"
